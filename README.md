# GitHub Repository Cleanup Script

This repository contains scripts to help you manage your GitHub repositories, specifically for fetching a list of your repositories and deleting selected ones.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

- **Node.js**: Version 14.x or higher is required. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm (Node Package Manager)**: This comes bundled with Node.js. You'll use it to install dependencies.

### GitHub Credentials

To interact with the GitHub API, you'll need to provide your GitHub credentials:

- **GitHub Username**: Your GitHub account username.
- **Personal Access Token (PAT)**: A security token that allows the script to access your GitHub account. Follow these steps to create one:

  1. Go to your GitHub account settings: [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
  2. Click on **Generate new token** (or **Generate new token (classic)**).
  3. Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "GitHub Repo Cleanup Script").
  4. **Crucially, select the following scopes (permissions) for the token:**
     - `repo` (This grants access to public and private repositories.)
     - `delete_repo` (This allows the script to delete repositories.)
  5. Click **Generate token**.
  6. **Copy the generated token and store it securely.** You will need to add it to your `.env` file in the next step.

  **Important Security Notes:**

  - **Treat your Personal Access Token like a password.** Never share it publicly, commit it to your repository, or expose it in client-side code.
  - **Be aware that the generated Access Token has the permissions you granted it.** Only grant the necessary permissions for the script to function.
  - **While the documentation mentions a 30-day validity for some tokens, Personal Access Tokens you create manually generally do not expire unless you revoke them.** However, it's good practice to review your tokens periodically.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cleph01/github-repo-cleanup-tool.git
   cd github-repo-cleanup-tool
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

```Bash

npm install
```

This command will install the @octokit/core package, which is used to communicate with the GitHub API.

## Usage

The script consists of two main parts: fetching your repositories and deleting selected ones.

**1. Configure Environment Variables**

You need to create a .env file in the root of your project to store your GitHub credentials securely.

- Create a .env file:

```Bash

touch .env
```

- Edit the .env file and add your GitHub username and the Personal Access Token you generated earlier:

```Code snippet

GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN = your_personal_access_token
GITHUB_USERNAME = your_username
```

Replace `your_personal_access_token` and `your_username` with your actual credentials.

**2. Running the Scripts**

The `package.json` file includes several npm scripts to run the different parts of the process:

- `npm run start`: Runs both the fetch-repos.js script (to get your repository list) followed by the delete-repos.js script (to delete selected repositories).
- `npm run fetch`: Executes only the fetch-repos.js script. This script fetches a list of your repositories and saves their full names to a file named my-repos.json.
- `npm run delete`: Executes only the delete-repos.js script. Important: This script relies on a file named repos-for-deletion.json which you need to manually create and populate (see the next step).
- `npm run fetch-and-delete`: This is an alias for npm run start, running both scripts sequentially.

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

**1. Fetch your list of repositories:**

Run the following command to fetch a list of your GitHub repositories:

```Bash

npm run fetch
```

This will create a file named my-repos.json in the root of your project containing a list of your repository full names (e.g., "cleph01/my-awesome-repo").

**2. Select repositories for deletion:**

- Manually create a new file named `repos-for-deletion.json` in the root of your project.
- Open both `my-repos.json` and `repos-for-deletion.json` in a text editor.
- Carefully review the list in `my-repos.json` and copy the full names of the repositories you want to delete into the `repos-for-deletion.json` file. The `repos-for-deletion.json` file should contain a JSON array of strings, like this example:

```JSON

[
"cleph01/repo-to-delete-1",
"cleph01/another-repo"
]
```

- Double-check the `repos-for-deletion.json` file to ensure you have only included the repositories you intend to delete. Deleting a repository is a permanent action!

**3. Delete the selected repositories:**

Once you have populated the repos-for-deletion.json file with the repositories you want to remove, run the following command:

```Bash

npm run delete
```

The script will then attempt to delete each repository listed in repos-for-deletion.json. The results of each deletion attempt (success or failure) will be logged to the console and also saved in a file named `deleted-repos.json`.

Alternatively, you can run both steps sequentially with:

```Bash

npm run start
```

or

```Bash

npm run fetch-and-delete
```

However, it is highly recommended to run `npm run fetch` first, carefully review and populate `repos-for-deletion.json`, and then run `npm run delete` separately to avoid accidental data loss.
